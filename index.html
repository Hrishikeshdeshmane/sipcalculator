<h1><b><p class="p2">SIP Calculator – Systematic Investment Plan Calculator</p></b></h1>
<h3>
<p class="p1">

Prospective investors can think that SIPs and mutual funds are the same.
 However, SIPs are merely a method of investing in mutual funds, the other 
 method being a lump sum. A SIP calculator is a tool that helps you determine
 the returns you can avail when parking your funds in such investment tools.
 Systematic Investment Plan or SIP is a process of investing a fixed sum of 
 money in mutual funds at regular intervals. SIPs usually allow you to invest
 weekly, quarterly, or monthly.

<h2>What is a SIP Calculator?</h2>
<p class="p1"><h3>
A SIP calculator is a simple tool that allows individuals to get
 an idea of the returns on their mutual fund investments made 
 through SIP. SIP investments in mutual funds have become one 
 of the most popular investment options for millennials lately.
These mutual fund sip calculators are designed to give potential 
investors an estimate on their mutual fund investments. However, 
the actual returns offered by a mutual fund scheme varies 
depending on various factors. The SIP calculator does not 
provide clarification for the exit load and expense ratio 
(if any).This calculator will calculate the wealth gain and 
expected returns for your monthly SIP investment. Indeed, you
 get a rough estimate on the maturity amount for any of your
 monthly SIP, based on a projected annual return rate.
</h3>
</p>
<br>
<h2>How can a SIP return calculator help you?</h2>
<h3>
SIPs are a more lucrative mode of investing funds compared to
 a lump sum amount according to several mutual fund experts. 
 It helps you become financially disciplined and create a habit
 of savings that can benefit you in the future.

A SIP calculator online is a beneficial tool, which shows 
the estimated returns you will earn after the investment tenure.

Few of the benefits of SIP calculators include –

1)Assists you to determine the amount you want to invest in.
2)Tells you the total amount you have invested.
3)Gives an estimated value of the returns.
